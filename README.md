## Usage

This project is a ReactJS powered portfolio showcasing the technologies and skills I've learned, and the work I've done throughout the boot camp. It was built using a single page and the content is rendered with React. There is a singluar navigation bar that floats at the bottom of the screen and allows easy navigation to anywhere on the page.
